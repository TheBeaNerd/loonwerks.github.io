The accepted wisdom is that combinational circuits must have
acyclic (i.e., loop-free or feed-forward) topologies.
And yet simple examples suggest that this need not be so. In
previous work, we advocated the design of cyclic combinational
circuits (i.e., circuits with loops or feedback paths). We proposed
a methodology for synthesizing such circuits and demonstrated
that it produces significant improvements in area and in delay.
The analysis method that we used to validate cyclic circuits was
based on binary decision diagrams. In this paper, we propose
a much more efficient technique for analysis based on Boolean
satisfiability (SAT).
