The accepted wisdom is that combinational circuits must have
acyclic
(i.e., feed-forward) topologies. Yet
simple examples suggest that this is incorrect. In fact, introducing cycles (i.e., feedback) into combinational
designs can lead to significant savings in area and in delay. Prior work described methodologies for syn-
thesizing cyclic circuits with sum-of-product (SOP) and binary-decision diagram (BDD)-based formulations.
Recently, techniques for
analyzing
and
mapping
cyclic circuits based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) were
proposed. This paper presents a SAT-based methodology for
synthesizing
cyclic dependencies. The strat-
egy is to generate cyclic functional dependencies through a technique called Craig interpolation. Given a
choice of different functional dependencies, a branch-and-bound search is performed to pick the best one.
Experiments on benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
