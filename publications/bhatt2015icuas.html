Advanced capabilities planned for the next generation
of unmanned aircraft will be based on complex new algorithms
and non-traditional software elements. These aircraft
will incorporate adaptive and intelligent control algorithms that
will provide enhanced safety, autonomy, and high-level decisionmaking
functions normally performed by human pilots, as well
as robustness in the presence of failures and adverse flight
conditions.
This paper discusses the characteristics of adaptive algorithms
and the challenges they present to certification for
operation in the National Airspace System (NAS). We provide
mitigations strategies that may make it possible to overcome
these challenges.
