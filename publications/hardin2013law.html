In our current work, we need to create a library of formally
verified software component models from code that has been
compiled (or decompiled) using the Low-Level Virtual Machine
(LLVM) intermediate form; these components, in turn,
are to be assembled into subsystems whose top-level assurance
relies on the assurance of the individual components.
Thus, we have undertaken a project to build a translator
from LLVM to the applicative subset of Common Lisp accepted
by the ACL2 theorem prover. Our translator produces
executable ACL2 specifications featuring tail recursion,
as well as in-place updates via ACL2’s single-threaded
object (stobj) mechanism. This allows us to efficiently support
validation of our models by executing production tests
for the original artifacts against those models. Unfortunately,
features that make a formal model executable are often
at odds with efficient reasoning. Thus, we also present a
technique for reasoning about tail-recursive ACL2 functions
that execute in-place, utilizing a formally proven “bridge” to
primitive-recursive versions of those functions operating on
lists.
