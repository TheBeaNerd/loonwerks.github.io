Guardol is a domain-specific language designed to facilitate the
construction of correct network guards operating over tree-shaped
data. The Guardol system generates Ada code from Guardol programs and
also provides specification and automated verification support. Guard
programs and specifications are translated to higher order logic, then
deductively transformed to a form suitable for a SMT-style decision
procedure for recursive functions over tree-structured data.  The
result is that difficult properties of Guardol programs can be proved
fully automatically.
