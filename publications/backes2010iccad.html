Craig Interpolation is a state-of-the-art technique
for logic synthesis and verification, based on Boolean Satisfiability
(SAT). Leveraging the efficacy of SAT algorithms, Craig Interpo-
lation produces solutions quickly to challenging problems such
as synthesizing functional dependencies and performing bounded
model-checking. Unfortunately, the quality of the solutions is
often poor. When interpolants are used to synthesize functional
dependencies, the resulting structure of the functions may be
unnecessarily complex. In most applications to date, interpolants
have been generated directly from the proofs of unsatisfiability
that are provided by SAT solvers. In this work, we propose
efficient methods based on incremental SAT solving for modifying
resolution proofs in order to obtain more compact interpolants.
This, in turn, reduces the cost of the logic that is generated for
functional dependencies.
