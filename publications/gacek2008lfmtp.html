The approach to reasoning about structural operational semantics style
specifications supported by the Abella system is discussed. This
approach uses lambda tree syntax to treat object language binding and
encodes binding related properties in generic judgments. Further,
object language specifications are embedded directly into the
reasoning framework through recursive definitions. The treatment of
binding via generic judgments implicitly enforces distinctness and
atomicity in the names used for bound variables. These properties
must, however, be made explicit in reasoning tasks. This objective can
be achieved by allowing recursive definitions to also specify generic
properties of atomic predicates. The utility of these various logical
features in the Abella system is demonstrated through actual reasoning
tasks. Brief comparisons with a few other logic based approaches are
also made.
