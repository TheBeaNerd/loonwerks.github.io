<i>Virtual integration</i> techniques focus on building architectural
models of systems that can be analyzed early in the design cycle to
try to lower cost, reduce risk, and improve quality of complex
embedded systems. Given appropriate architectural descriptions and
compositional reasoning rules, these techniques can be used to prove
important safety properties about the architecture prior to system
construction. Such proofs build from "leaf-level" assume/guarantee
component contracts through architectural layers towards top-level
safety properties. The proofs are built upon the premise that each
leaf-level component contract is <i>realizable</i>; i.e., it is
possible to construct a component such that for any input allowed by
the contract assumptions, there is some output value that the
component can produce that satisfies the contract guarantees. Without
engineering support it is all too easy to write leaf-level components
that can't be realized. Realizability checking for propositional
contracts has been well-studied for many years, both for component
synthesis and checking correctness of temporal logic requirements.
However, checking realizability for contracts involving infinite
theories is still an open problem. In this paper, we describe a new
approach for checking realizability of contracts involving theories
and demonstrate its usefulness on several examples.
