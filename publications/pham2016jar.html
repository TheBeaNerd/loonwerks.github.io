<p>
Reasoning about functions that operate over algebraic data types is an
important problem for a large variety of applications. One application
of particular interest is network applications that manipulate or
reason about complex message structures, such as XML messages. This
paper presents a decision procedure for reasoning about algebraic data
types using abstractions that are provided by catamorphisms: fold
functions that map instances of algebraic data types to values in a
decidable domain. We show that the procedure is sound and complete for
a class of catamorphisms that satisfy a generalized sufficient
surjectivity condition. Our work extends a previous decision procedure
that unrolls catamorphism functions until a solution is found.

<p>
We use the generalized sufficient surjectivity condition to address an
incompleteness in the previous unrolling algorithm (and associated
proof). We then propose the categories of monotonic and associative
catamorphisms, which we argue provide a more intuitive inclusion test
than the generalized sufficient surjectivity condition. We use these
notions to address two open problems from previous work: (1) we
provide a bound, with respect to formula size, on the number of
unrollings necessary for completeness, showing that it is linear for
monotonic catamorphisms and exponentially small for associative
catamorphisms, and (2) we demonstrate that associative catamorphisms
can be combined within a formula while preserving completeness. Our
combination results extend the set of problems that can be reasoned
about using the catamorphism-based approach.
</p>

<p>
We also describe an implementation of the approach, called RADA, which
accepts formulas in an extended version of the SMT-LIB 2.0 syntax. The
procedure is quite general and is central to the reasoning
infrastructure for Guardol, a domain-specific language for reasoning
about network guards.
