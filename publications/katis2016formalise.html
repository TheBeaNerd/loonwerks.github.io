<p>
In previous work, we have introduced a contract-based realizability
checking algorithm for assume-guarantee contracts involving infinite
theories, such as linear integer/real arithmetic and uninterpreted
functions over infinite domains. This algorithm can determine whether
or not it is possible to construct a realization (i.e. an
implementation) of an assume-guarantee contract. The algorithm is
similar to k-induction model checking, but involves the use of
quantifiers to determine implementability. While our work on
realizability is inherently useful for virtual integration in
determining whether it is possible for suppliers to build software
that meets a contract, it also provides the foundations to solving the
more challenging problem of component synthesis. In this paper, we
provide an initial synthesis algorithm for assume-guarantee contracts
involving infinite theories. To do so, we take advantage of our
realizability checking procedure and a skolemization solver for
forall-exists formulas, called AE-VAL. We show that it is possible to
immediately adapt our existing algorithm towards synthesis by using
this solver, using a demonstration example. We then discuss challenges
towards creating a more robust synthesis algorithm.
