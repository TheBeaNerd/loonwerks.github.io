merging
technologies
for
nanoscale
computation such
as self-assembled
nanowire
arrays
present
special
challenges for logic synthesis.
On
the one
hand,
they
provide an unprecedented density
of
bits with
a
high
degree
of parallelism. On
the
other
hand, they
are
characterized
by
high
defect
rates. Also
they
often exhibit
inherent randomness
in
the
interconnects
due
to
the stochastic
nature
of self-assembly.
We
describe
a general
method for
synthesizing logic that exploits both
the parallelism
and the
random
effects. Our approach is based
on
stochastic computation
with parallel bit
streams. Circuits
are
synthesized through functional decomposition
with
symbolic
data
structures called multiplicative
binary
moment
diagrams.
synthesis produces
designs
with randomized parallel components--and operations and multiplexing--that
are
readily implemented
in
nanowire crossbar
arrays.
Synthesis results
for
benchmark
circuits
show
that our technique maps
circuit
designs
onto
nanowire
arrays effectively.
