Modern defense systems must be implemented as redundant,
fault-tolerant systems in order to meet their reliability
requirements. Unfortunately, developing protocols to achieve
distributed agreement in an asynchronous environment can be
deceptively difficult. Engineers often exploit the fact that their
systems are quasi-synchronous, where even though the clocks of the
different nodes are not synchronized, they run at the same rate, or
multiples of the same rate, modulo their drift and jitter. While such
designs often appear to work correctly, their intrinsic asynchrony
makes them prone to latent race and deadlock conditions. This project
provide systems designers with an intuitive modeling environment that
1) allows systems engineers to easily specify the high-level
architecture and synchronization logic of quasi-synchronous systems
using widely available system engineering notations and tools, and 2)
integrates and enhances innovative formal verification tools to
provide them with immediate feedback on the correctness of their
designs
