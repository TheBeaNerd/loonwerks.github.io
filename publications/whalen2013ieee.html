Systems are naturally constructed in hierarchies, in which design
choices made at higher levels of abstraction levy requirements on
system components at the lower levels. Thus, whether an aspect of a
system is a design choice or a requirement largely depends on your
vantage point within the system components' hierarchy. Systems are
also often constructed from the middle-out rather than top-down;
compatibility with existing systems and architectures and availability
of specific components influence high-level requirements. Requirements
and architectural design should be more closely aligned: requirements
models must account for hierarchical system construction and
architectural design notations must better support requirements
specification for system components.
