Formal methods tools have been shown to be effective at finding defects in and verifying the correctness
of safety-critical systems such as avionics systems. The recent release of DO-178C and the accompanying
Formal Methods Supplement DO-333 will make it easier for developers of software for commercial aircraft
to obtain certification credit for the use of formal methods. However, most developers of avionics systems
are unfamiliar with formal methods, and most developers of formal methods tools are unfamiliar with certification requirements and processes. This article provides a brief overview of the certification process for commercial aircraft, as well as some of the issues related to the use of formal methods tools in this context.
