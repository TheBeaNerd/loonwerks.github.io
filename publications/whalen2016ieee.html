In the High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems project, researchers are
investigating how to construct complex networked-vehicle software
securely. Experiments demonstrated that careful attention to
requirements and system architecture, along with formally verified
approaches that remove known security weaknesses, can lead to vehicles
that can withstand attacks from even sophisticated attackers with
access to vehicle design data.
