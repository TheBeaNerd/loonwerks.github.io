RTCA DO-333, Formal Methods Supplement to DO-178C and DO-278A provides guidance for 
software developers wishing to use formal methods in the certification of airborne systems and 
air traffic management systems. The supplement identifies the modifications and additions to 
DO-178C and DO-278A objectives, activities, and software life cycle data that should be 
addressed when formal methods are used as part of the software development process. This 
report presents three case studies describing the use of different classes of formal methods to 
satisfy certification objectives for a common avionics example - a dual-channel Flight Guidance 
System. The three case studies illustrate the use of theorem proving, model checking, and 
abstract interpretation. The material presented is not intended to represent a complete 
certification effort. Rather, the purpose is to illustrate how formal methods can be used in a 
realistic avionics software development project, with a focus on the evidence produced that could 
be used to satisfy the verification objectives found in Section 6 of DO-178C.
