The intrinsic treatment of binding in the lambda calculus makes it an
ideal data structure for representing syntactic objects with binding
such as formulas, proofs, types, and programs. Supporting such a data
structure in an implementation is made difficult by the complexity of
the substitution operation relative to lambda terms. In this paper we
present the suspension calculus, an explicit treatment of meta level
binding in the lambda calculus. We prove properties of this calculus
which make it a suitable replacement for the lambda calculus in
implementation. Finally, we compare the suspension calculus with other
explicit treatments of substitution.
