This paper describes a design flow and supporting tools to significantly 
improve the design and verification of complex cyber-physical systems. We focus 
on system architecture models composed from libraries of components and 
complexity-reducing design patterns having formally verified properties. This 
allows new system designs to be developed rapidly using patterns that have been 
shown to reduce unnecessary complexity and coupling between components. 
Components and patterns are annotated with formal contracts describing their 
guaranteed behaviors and the contextual assumptions that must be satisfied for 
their correct operation. We describe the compositional reasoning framework that 
we have developed for proving the correctness of a system design, and provide a 
proof of the soundness of our compositional reasoning approach. An example 
based on an aircraft flight control system is provided to illustrate the method and 
supporting analysis tools.
