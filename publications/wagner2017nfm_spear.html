This paper describes current progress on SpeAR, a novel tool
for capturing and analyzing requirements in a domain specific language
designed to read like natural language. Using SpeAR, system engineers
capture requirements, environmental assumptions, and critical system
properties using the formal semantics of Past LTL. SpeAR analyzes re-
quirements for logical consistency and uses model checking to prove that
assumptions and requirements entail stated properties. These analyses
build confidence in the correctness of the formally captured requirements.
