In this paper we detail our effort to formalize and prove
requirements for the Quad-redundant Flight Control System (QFCS)
within NASA's Transport Class Model (TCM). We use a compositional
approach with assume-guarantee contracts that correspond to the requirements 
for software components embedded in an AADL system architecture model. 
This approach is designed to exploit the verification
effort and artifacts that are already part of typical software verification
processes in the avionics domain. Our approach is supported by an AADL
annex that allows specification of contracts along with a
tool called AGREE for performing compositional verification. The goal of this paper is
to show the benefits of a compositional verification approach applied to
a realistic avionics system and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
AGREE tool in performing this analysis.
