Virtual integration techniques focus on building architectural models
of systems that can be analyzed early in the design cycle to try to
lower cost, reduce risk, and improve quality of complex embedded
systems. Given appropriate architectural descriptions,
assume/guarantee contracts, and compositional reasoning rules, these
techniques can be used to prove important safety properties about the
architecture prior to system construction. For these proofs to be
meaningful, each leaf-level component contract must be realizable;
i.e., it is possible to construct a component such that for any input
allowed by the contract assumptions, there is some output value that
the component can produce that satisfies the contract guarantees.

We have recently proposed (in [1]) a contract-based realizability
checking algorithm for assume/guarantee contracts over infinite
theories supported by SMT solvers such as linear integer/real
arithmetic and uninterpreted functions. In that work, we used an SMT
solver and an algorithm similar to k-induction to establish the
realizability of a contract, and justified our approach via a hand
proof. Given the central importance of realizability to our virtual
integration approach, we wanted additional confidence that our
approach was sound. This paper describes a complete formalization of
the approach in the Coq proof and specification language. During
formalization, we found several small mistakes and missing assumptions
in our reasoning. Although these did not compromise the correctness of
the algorithm used in the checking tools, they point to the value of
machine-checked formalization. In addition, we believe this is the
first machine-checked formalization for a realizability algorithm.
