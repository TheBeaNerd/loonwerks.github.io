<p>
The Static IMPerative AnaLyzer (SIMPAL) is a tool for performing
compositional reasoning over software programs that utilize
preexisting software components. SIMPAL features a specification
language, called Limp, for modeling programs that utilize preexisting
components. Limp is a Lustre-like imperative language. It provides
control flow elements, global variables, and a syntax for specifying
preconditions, postconditions, and global variable interactions of
preexisting components.

<p>
SIMPAL translates Limp programs to an equivalent Lustre
representationwhich can be passed to the JKind model checking tool to
perform assume-guarantee reasoning, reachability, and viability
analyses. The feedback from these analyses can be used to refine the
program to ensure the software functions as intended.
