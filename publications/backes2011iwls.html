the results of modern synthesis tools are heavily
influenced by the initial structure of the designs they are given.
Many synthesis tools use And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) as the
underlying representation in the technology-independent phase
of synthesis. Generally, AIGs can be compacted through a series
of operations that merge equivalent nodes. Proving nodes to be
equivalent can be a done with efficient SAT-based algorithms.
However, when an AIG consists of very sparse logic, compaction
is ineffective; few equivalent nodes are found.
Recently, techniques for generating functional dependencies
via Craig Interpolation have been proposed. Such methods first
generate a resolution proof from a SAT instance. Interpolation
is performed on the resolution proof to generate the dependency
function. Unlike nodes in an AIG, determining whether an
equivalent resolution node can be generated from other resolution
nodes is a simple task. In this work, we study the use of
resolution proofs as an underlying data structure for performing
technology-independent synthesis, as opposed to just the front-
end step. In order to represent multiple functions, we merge
separate resolution proofs into a single, monolithic resolution
proof and then perform restructuring operations. We analyze
the effectiveness of our method on standard benchmark circuits.
The results suggest that resolution proofs could be a very effective
data structure for representing multiple target functions.
