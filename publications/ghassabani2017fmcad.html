<p>
Symbolic model checkers can construct proofs of safety properties over
complex models, but when a proof succeeds, the results do not
generally provide much insight to the user. Recently, proof cores
(alternately, for inductive model checkers, Inductive Validity Cores
(IVCs)) were introduced to trace a property to a minimal set of model
elements necessary for proof. Minimal IVCs facilitate several
engineering tasks, including performing traceability and analyzing
requirements completeness, that usually rely on the minimality of
IVCs. However, existing algorithms for generating an IVC are either
expensive or only able to find an approximately minimal IVC.

<p>
Besides minimality, computing all minimal IVCs of a given property is
an interesting problem that provides several useful analyses,
including regression analysis for testing/proof, determination of the
minimum (as opposed to minimal) number of model elements necessary for
proof, the diversity examination of model elements leading to proof,
and analyzing fault tolerance.

<p>
This paper proposes an efficient method for finding all minimal IVCs
of a given property proving its correctness and completeness.We
benchmark our algorithm against existing IVC-generating algorithms and
show, in many cases, the cost of finding all minimal IVCs by our
technique is similar to finding a single minimal IVC using existing
algorithms.
