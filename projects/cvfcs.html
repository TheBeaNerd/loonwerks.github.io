<p>Advanced capabilities planned for the next generation of aircraft and the Next Generation
Air Transportation System (NextGen) will be based on complex new software. Integrated
Modular Avionics (IMA) will enable the implementation of more functionality in software and
tighter integration of these functions to improve aircraft efficiency. Aircraft will incorporate
adaptive control algorithms that will provide enhanced safety and robustness in the
presence of failures and adverse flight conditions. NextGen will encompass airborne and
ground-based nodes with significant computational elements acting in coordination to
maintain a safe and efficient airspace.</p>

<p>However, there are serious barriers to the deployment of these new capabilities. As these
systems have grown in complexity, their verification has become the single most costly
development activity. The verification costs of even more complex NextGen systems in the
future will impact safety not just through an increasing incidence of errors and unforeseen
interactions, but by delaying and preventing the deployment of crucial safety functions.</p>

<p>In this NASA-funded project we are addressing these challenges by developing a framework for compositional
verification that will permit the verification of systems that exceed the complexity limits of
current approaches. Our approach is based on:
<ul>
<li>Modeling the system architecture using the industry standard notations that engineers will be using</li>
<li>Developing a sophisticated translation framework that automates the translation of these models for analysis by
powerful general purpose verification engines such as model checkers and theorem provers</li>
<li>Developing techniques for compositional verification based on the system
architecture to divide the verification task into manageable, reusable pieces </li>
</ul>
This will significantly reduce verification costs by identifying and correcting system design errors
early in the life cycle rather than waiting until system integration. We are validating
this approach and the tools we develop on a realistic fault-tolerant flight control system model.</p>

<p>Our compositional approach exploits the verification effort and artifacts that are
already part of typical software component verification work. We use
formal assume-guarantee contracts that correspond to the requirements for each
component. Each component in the system model is annotated with a contract that
includes the requirements and constraints that were specified and verified as part of its
development process. We then reason about the system-level behavior based on the
interaction of the component contracts. This approach allows us to leverage  existing
development processes for software components and provides a scalable way to reason about
the system as a whole.</p>
