<p> During the summer of 2017 we participated in Air Force Research
Laboratory's (AFRL) Summer of Innovation (SoI) program. The program leveraged
AFRL's Unmanned Systems Autonomy Services (UxAS) as a basis to create
a truly modular, open, and verifiable in-house UAV autonomy
architecture. The program was modeled after the "Google Summer of
Code" program. It was a 14-week "innovation workshop" with a team of
experts from academia, government, and industry working together in a
facility located in downtown Dayton, OH. The team of approximately 50
experts in formal methods and software design leveraged an open source
version of UxAS and the AFRL AMASE simulation platform to develop
formal evidence for the correctness of the platform. When it was
discovered that the existing system did not meet certain requirements,
the team augmented UxAS in order to prove that it functioned as
intended. </p>

<p> In this project we used our AADL analysis tools (AGREE and
Resolute) to reason about properties of the UxAS architecture. We also
applied technologies developed under the HACMS project to
re-architect UxAS and formally prove that it met certain
safety guarantees.</p>
