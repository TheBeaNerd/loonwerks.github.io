<p>Formal methods tools are expected to play a larger role in implementing and
certifying safety-critical systems over the next decade. Updated certification
guidance for airborne software was recently published in RTCA DO-178C.  A 
companion document, DO-333, the formal methods supplement, allows applicants to receive certification credit for
verification conducted using formal methods.  DO-330, Software Tool Qualification
Considerations, provides guidance for developers and users of software tools for
safety-critical domains. DO-330 qualification of formal methods tools,
and more generally, the larger question of formal methods tool dependability,
forms a largely unexplored area of study.</p>

<p>This NASA-funded project investigated what
sorts of assurances are necessary and appropriate to justify the application of
formal methods tools throughout all phases of design in real safety-critical
settings. We produced practical examples on how to qualify typical formal 
verification tools in each of the three categories identified in DO-333 (theorem proving, 
model checking, and abstract interpretation) and explored promising new approaches 
to the qualification of formal methods tools. We produced the qualification artifacts for an open source formal
verification tool, the <A href="http://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/Kind/">Kind model checker</A>. We also investigated the feasibility of independently verifying tool outputs through the generation of a proof certificate and verification of the certificate with a qualified proof checker.</p>

<p>As part of the project, we organized a <A href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/15182">Dagstuhl Seminar</A> to explore the subject of tool qualification with the formal methods research community.</p>

<p>Final results from the project are available as a 
<a href=https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/FMinCert/DO-330-case-studies-RC.html>NASA Contractor Report</a>, along with the case study qualification tests and tools.</p>
