<p>
Jennifer (Jen) Davis is a Senior Applied Mathematician in the Advanced Technology Center at Rockwell Collins. 
Dr. Davis has served as the Rockwell Collins Principal Investigator for multiple U.S. DoD programs in the area of 
formal methods. She has experience applying the <a href="/tools/spear.html">SpeAR</a> tool to document and analyze the 
formal requirements for a new architecture. She also has experience using <a href="/tools/agree.html">AGREE</a> to 
formalize an instantiation of the simplex architecture together with its requirements. 
</p>

<p>
Dr. Davis has experience with state of the art theorem proving tools. She jointly developed a translator from LLVM to ACL2 
to enable verification of system properties. She also used PVS to complete correctness proofs 
for the <a href="/projects/do333.html">DO-333</a> theorem proving case study.  In addition to Dr. Davisâ€™ formal methods 
skills, she has experience with cryptography, error-correcting codes, image processing, model-based engineering, and 
cybersecurity. She earned her Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 2007.
