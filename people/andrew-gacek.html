<p>
Andrew's expertise is integrating new and exciting research topics
into tools which put formal methods in the hands of real users. Andrew
is the author of <a href="/tools/jkind.html">JKind</a>, an
infinite-state model checker for safety properties. He advocates for
the use of JKind which now underlies tools such
as <a href="/tools/agree.html">AGREE</a>, <a href="/tools/spear.html">SpeAR</a>,
and
<a href="https://github.com/lgwagner/SIMPAL">SIMPAL</a>. In addition,
JKind serves as a research platform to investigate topics such
as <a href="/publications/gacek2015nfm.html">realizability</a>
and <a href="/publications/ghassabani2016fse.html">inductive validity
cores</a>. Andrew also created
the <a href="http://abella-prover.org/">Abella theorem prover</a> and
the <a href="/tools/resolute.html">Resolute</a> assurance case tool.
</p>

<p>
Andrew's broader interests include theorem proving, model checking,
language translation, software design, operating systems, and embedded
systems.
