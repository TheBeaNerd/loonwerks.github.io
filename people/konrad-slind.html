Dr. Konrad Slind has been a member of the Rockwell Collins Advanced
Technology Center since 2009. He has previously worked at the
University of Calgary (MSc), Bell Labs Murray Hill (Consultant),
Technical University of Munich (PhD), Cambridge University Computer
Lab (Post-Doc), and University of Utah School of Computing
(faculty). Dr. Slind has led research projects funded by the
University of Utah, the NSF, and the NSA.

Slind's research has focused on the theory and application of formal
methods. For his MSc work, Slind implemented the HOL (higher order
logic) theorem prover in Standard ML. He has developed HOL ever since,
lately in collaboration with colleagues at NICTA and Cambridge
University. His PhD work investigated the theory and implementation of
general recursion and induction, in both HOL-4 and Isabelle/HOL.

Slind has published in a variety of areas: hardware verification and
synthesis, distributed systems, verifying compilation, specification
of multiprocessor memory models, verification of cryptographic block
ciphers, and verification of functional programs.

Dr. Slind is currently technical lead on an NSA-sponsored project at
Rockwell Collins, with the goal to design and implement the Guardol
programming environment. Guardol is aimed at constructing and
automatically verifying secure network guards. Guardol programs are
given a formal semantics in HOL-4, and guard correctness proofs are
automated by verified transformation of proof obligations into a
recently invented decision procedure for functional
programming. Current research is developing verified generation of
guard hardware from specifications in the language of regular
expressions.
