<p>
The Specification and Analysis of Requirements (SpeAR) tool is a tool for prototyping and analyzing requirements. It uses a specification language on the front-end to ease the system's engineers transition from writing natural language specification to formalizable specifications. The process is not automated; engineers will have to take natural language text and determine how to formalize them.
</p>

<p>
Once formalized, SpeAR will translate the specification to an equivalent Lustre model and analyze that the derived requirements permit (or prohibit) certain desired (or undesired) behaviors. It also supports the ability to check a specification for logical consistency and realizability, which help identify logical conflicts and unrealizable conditions.

<p>SpeAR was developed by Rockwell Collins in collaboration with AFRL and under AFRL funding.</p>
